# Lunch Line Simulator
Objective: 
  - Functions as a real school lunchline
Constraints: 
  - 20 people can be on line at a time
  - If more than 20 then people then they will be out in the hallway which means automatic detention for the student by    
    dean mean (handled with dean mean exception)
 How it works:
  - There is a menu that allows you to do what you like such as:
      -serving a student
      -letting a student cut in line infront of a friend
      -bully a student out of their money which will make them leave the line
      -you can also switch between realities incase you don't like how you have changed the line so far
      -you can copy one reality into the other
